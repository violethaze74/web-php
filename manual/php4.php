<h1>Documentation for PHP 4</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
 The PHP 4 documentation was removed from the PHP Manual in August 2014,
 approximately six years after PHP 4 reached its end of life. However, we have
 provided downloadable copy of manual for anyone who would need it.
</p>

<h2>PHP 4 Manual</h2>
<p>
 An attempt was made to preserve as many documentation related to PHP 4, as it is
 possible. Despite this, we don't have nice, separate manual covering only PHP 4.
 The reason for this is how our documentation is structured. Even so, archived copy
 describes more ascpets of PHP 4 than actual manual described in August 2014 (e.g.
 it covers more PHP 4 extensions).
</p>

<p>
 To download copy of the manual for PHP 4, see the <a href="http://doc.php.net/archives/">
 documentation archives</a>. Please, remember, that archived version <strong>should not
 </strong> be used in everyday development, unless you are developing PHP 4 applications.
 This version lacks many topics connected with PHP 5 and it is not updated anymore.
</p>

<h2>Migrating to PHP 5</h2>
<p>
 All users are strongly encouraged to upgrade their environments to PHP 5.
 Please, read guide for <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/migration5.php">Migrating
 from PHP 4 to PHP 5.0.x</a> and <a href="http://php.net/manual/en/faq.migration5.php">
